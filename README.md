# ðŸ‘‹ Hello developer!

This is a Rust with Rocket web framework project template. Check our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to learn the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp). Check out the official Rust documentation (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) to learn the basics of the Rust programming language, and Rocket's guide (https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/) to learn about the Rocket web framework

## Knowledge requirements

To be able to fully understand and modify this project, you should know (or learn):

Rust programming language
Rocket web framework
Handlebars

## ðŸ”¨ What's next?

Customize this project to make it your own. Implement new features, modify existing ones, or integrate it with other technologies.

## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

The project is structured as follows:

src folder contains the project's source code.
static folder contains the static resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript files).
templates folder contains the handlebars templates.
Rocket.toml contains the application properties.
Cargo.toml contains application dependencies.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note

For now, files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
When you're in the editor, the dev server will automatically be running and any changes you make will automatically restart the app.
